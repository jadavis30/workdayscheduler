# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Features
Tasks are colored for user based on past, present, and future.
Tasks can be edited and saved.
Furthemore, tasks now wipe on a new day to allow user to have a blank page, BUT data persists in localstorage and can be called back. Will update in the future to allow user to select prior data.
